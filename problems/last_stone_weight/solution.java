*** implemented in Java as Javascript doesn't support PriorityQueue out of the box ***

This question is asked by Amazon. You are given a group of stones, all of which have a positive weight. At each turn, we select the heaviest two stones and smash them together. When smashing these two stones together, one of two things can happen:

If the stones are both the same weight, both stones are destroyed
If the weights of the stones are not equal, the smaller of the two stones is destroyed and the remaining stoneâ€™s weight is updated to the difference (i.e. if we smash two stones together of weight 3 and weight 5 the stone with weight 3 is destroyed and the stone with original weight 5 now has weight 2).
Continue smashing stones together until there is at most one stone left and return the weight of the remaining stone. If not stones remain, return zero.

class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int stone: stones) {
            maxHeap.add(stone);
        }

        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int stone1 = maxHeap.remove();
            int stone2 = maxHeap.remove();
            if (stone1 != stone2) {
                maxHeap.add(Math.abs(stone1 - stone2));
            }
        }

        return maxHeap.isEmpty() ? 0 : maxHeap.remove();
    }
}

// Runtime: O(NlogN) where N is the total number of stones we are given. This results from removing N items from our heap where each of the N removals costs O(logN) time (i.e. the height of our heap).
// Space complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of stones we are given. This results from storing N elements in our max heap.
